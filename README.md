COVID-19 has left many people around the globe without their fifth sense: smell. It might seen silly, however, losing your sense of smell can drastically affect a person’s life. They will no longer be able to smell things burning and know that a problem is occurring. They will no longer be able to tell whether food has gone bad by smell alone. Perhaps worse, they won’t be able to smell any comforting scents, like their grandmother’s fabric softener or significant other’s perfume. Some individuals who have lost their sense of smell with little to no ability regained might have to do smell training to get their sense of smell back. 

Smell training can be done many different ways. However, our app creates two routines and two exercises to help people start their journey with smell training or regulate their everyday journey with smell training. The app doesn’t need the user to buy anything, everything that the app references can be found around most individuals’ houses!

This app was inspired by members of our team who have been affected by COVID. Some of them have had to use smell training to get back their sense of smell.
